Indian - E-Waybill
====================
To submit an E-Waybill through API to the government.
We use "Tera Software Limited" as GSP

Step 1: First you need to create an API username and password in the E-Waybill portal.
Step 2: Switch to the company related to that GST number
Step 3: Set that username and password in Odoo (Goto: Inventory/Configuration -> Settings -> Indian E-Waybill or find "E-Waybill" in search bar)
Step 4: Repeat steps 1,2,3 for all GSTIN you have in odoo. If you have a multi-company with the same GST number then perform step 1 for the first company only.
